## Project Details

### Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing
- **Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing** on a dataset with 50,000 rows and 27 columns using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.
- Visualized data trends and patterns by creating count plots, boxplots, and heatmaps using Seaborn and Matplotlib, enhancing insights into data distribution and relationships.

### Visualization
- **Count Plot:** Displays the count of observations in each categorical bin using bars.
